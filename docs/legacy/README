===== Dependencies =====

SATyrus depends on Python and python-ply ( http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ ). Please refer to your system documentation for information on how to install these modules if they're not currently available. AMPL ( http://www.ampl.com/ ) is needed in order to solve the resulting energy function.

====== Optional dependency ======

In order to get a simplified energy function, you'll need to install python-sympy ( http://code.google.com/p/sympy/ ).

===== Installing and Running =====

From the current directory, you can either run SATyrus from command line:

    $ ./satyrus

or install it system wide

    $ python setup.py install # as admin user
    $ satyrus

==== Usage ====

=== Running SATyrus ===

To run SATyrus, type:

  $ satyrus /path/to/file

=== Options ===

To see the available options, simply type:

  $ satyrus --help

=== Example Usage ===

To compile a model named 'model.sat' using simplex as solver, type:

  $ satyrus --solver=cplex model.sat

In order to solve the energy function, just type:

  $ ampl < out.ampl
